This exercise was given as an introduction to the ```--amend``` flag of the ```git commit``` command <br> I did ``` nano file.txt ```  to take a look at the contents of *file.txt* <br><img width="162" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Chalhotra/git-exercises-writeups/assets/135652026/d6d3a39d-b563-440d-8f85-b1fcd91103f9">

on changing ***Hello wordl*** to ***Hello world***, and adding the file to the staging area, ```git add file.txt ```, the previous commit can be changed using ``` git commit --amend -m "Add Hello world"``` <br> and that solves this challenge
