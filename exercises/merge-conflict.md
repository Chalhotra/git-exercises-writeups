# Merge Conflict

The exercise has two branches with conflicting files, i.e both files with the same name that have different pieces of information on the same lines, to resolve this:
first of all I did ``` git merge another-piece-of-work``` which threw a **merge conflict**, to fix this merge conflict, I did ``` echo 2+3=5 > equation.txt``` which changed the contents of equation.txt to 2+3=5, and now we add the file back to the stage, and commit our changes to the merge, and the issue is reolved
