This challenge can be quite tedious and boring, cuz we have to extract bzip2, gzip and tar archives over and over again, and it seems like its going forever :/ 
<br>
<br>
The first step was to make a binary file out of the given hexdump, so I first made a new directory under 

``` /tmp ``` as instructed, and copied data.txt into that directory
<br>
```
mkdir /tmp/pintu
cp data.txt /tmp/pintu
```
<br>
This got data.txt into my new directory, where I now had to convert the hexdump to its binary, thankfully we have a single command that does this for us <br>

```
xxd -r data.txt pintu.txt
```
<br>
Now having made *pintu.txt*, I ran 

``` file pintu.txt ```
, which returned that it is a gzip compressed file
<br>
Decompressing this gzip archive, by first renaming pintu.txt to pintu.gz I got <br>

and now the tedious task of decompressing bzip2, gzip, and tar files, in the end I got the password <br>
