This is one of my favourite challenges, cuz through this challenge, I learnt for the first time what the 

``` ssh ``` command actually does, it doesn't just let u log into a remote server, but also lets u run commands remotely to a server while logging in, now since when we log in, .bashrc also gets loaded, we have some time for our remote commands to run, so there are actually 2 ways to solve this exercise <br>

## Spawning a completely different shell, other than Bash
  ``` 
  ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -t /bin/sh
```
  Does this for us, and now we can log in normally and use the shell to access the readme file, the ``` -t ``` flag lets us create a pseudo-terminal to run
