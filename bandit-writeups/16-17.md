After obtaining the password in the previous level, we just had to scan for open ports in the range 31000-32000 on localhost, and then check which of them communicated using openssl, and it turned out that there were only 5 ports, so brute forcing was the best option I guess :)

```
nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost

```
The above command gave me this output <br>

<br>

<br>
Now after trying to connect to every port, 31790 finally worked, and gave me this SSH private key on entering the password <br>

<br>

I now copied this text, made a file under 
``` /tmp/smthing ``` called ```sshkey.private ``` and pasted this key there <br>

Though, I made a couple of silly errors, and couldn't log into the next level for at least 3-4 tries, cuz I first forgot to change the file permissions to 600, i.e groups and other users can't access this file, cuz its a private RSA key, and then running this command gets us onto the next level <br>

```
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit17@localhost -p 2220
```
