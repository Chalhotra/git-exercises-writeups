This challenge basically requires us to compare the two files,

```passwords.old ``` 


and ```passwords.new``` line-by-line, and find the only line different between the two <br>
To our rescue, we have the ``` diff ``` command, which does exactly this <br>

```
diff passwords.new passwords.old 
```
<br>
The above command will give us all the lines different in passwords.new and passwords.old, in that order <br>

As we can clearly see, hga5tuuCLF6fFzUpnagiMN8ssu9LFrdg is the line different in the two, and hga5tuuCLF6fFzUpnagiMN8ssu9LFrdg exists in passwords.new, meaning that this is our password for the next level, again an easy challenge :)







password: hga5tuuCLF6fFzUpnagiMN8ssu9LFrdg
