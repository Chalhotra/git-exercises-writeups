In this challenge, we are required to find a file which is owned by user *bandit7*, group *bandit6*  and has a size of *33c* <br>
The command thus used is ``` find / -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6```, where thw *user* and *group* flags are used to check the ownership of the file/directory

<br>
This command lists us a lot of files, most of which we do not have perms to access, but we can clearly see a file path that is accessible

```
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

```

Now running ``` cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password ```
