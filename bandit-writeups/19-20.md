This was again one of the easier challenges, and was aimed at teaching the player the use of SETUID, i.e basically granting root or admin rights to a file
<br>
On 

``` ls -l ```, we can clearly see that the perms include *rwsr*, meaning that the file has SUID <br>

<br>
Now, we can run the file ``` ./bandit20-do```, and on running, we get an example of what the file does <br>

<br>
This description is very useful, as it basically gives away the password to the next level, since we can access bandit20's password file being bandit19 using the command below

```
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
```
