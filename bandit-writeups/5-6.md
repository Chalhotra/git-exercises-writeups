We had to find a file with the following properties:
*human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable*

so, using the flags of the find command, I specified the size as 1033c, ! -executable means that the file is not executable, and -type f refers to the type, i.e file 
``` find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable```
