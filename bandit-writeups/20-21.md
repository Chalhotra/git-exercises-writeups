In this level, we are required to send the password of the previous level over some port, and then use the given 

```suconnect``` binary to check the password, and give us the password for the next level <br>
Simply had to set up a temporary server on any localhost port using *netcat*, and then send our password over that, which can be done as follows <br>

```
echo -n 'VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT' | nc -l -p 4000 &
```
<br>
Here the *&* ensures that the command is running in the background, and now we can use suconnect to connect to port 4000 <br>
