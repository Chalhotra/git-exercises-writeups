This level requires us to find the only line in the file which has been repeated only once, we can use the 


```
uniq -c 
```
command piped to the ```sort ``` command, to achieve this, the ```sort``` command sorts all the lines, and ```uniq -c``` lists all the unique strings along with the number of their duplicates, so we can clearly see looking at the output of 
```
sort data.txt | uniq -c
```
that only one string has 1 as its count, and that is indeed our password for the next level :)
